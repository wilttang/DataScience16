    "First, we'll start with the question that Allen poses at the beginning of the chapter: \"Suppose we toss a coin 250 times and we see 140 heads.  Is this strong evidence that the coin is biased?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As Allen says, classical hypothesis testing is similar to a proof by contradiction.  First, we assume that the thing we are trying to show is false (that the coin is biased).  Second, we show that this leads to an observed event being excedingly improbable (seeing 140 heads out of 250 tosses).  Finally, we can conclude that our assumption (that the coin is not biased) is unlikely to be true.\n",

A two-tailed test would count simulations with 140 or more tails as well (which is what Allen shows in the book).  Whether to use a one-tailed or a two-tailed test mostly has to do with your prior expectations regarding the hypothesis you are testing.  For instance, if you had a reason to suspect that the coin would be biased towards heads (but not tails) you would use a one-tailed test.  If you had no reason to assume a priori that the coin was biased towards heads or tails, you should use a two-tailed test.\n",
