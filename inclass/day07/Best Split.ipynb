    "### Gini Impurity as a Metric for Best Split\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to talk about the \"best split\", we have to have some notion of what \"best\" means.  There are lots of [possible options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning).  The one we are going to examine here is called \"Gini impurity\".  The Gini impurity is a measure of the homegeneity of the points in a set.  Suppose that we have a set of $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ with target values $y_1, \\ldots, y_n$.  For simplicity, we will assume that each of the target values $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ (i.e. it is a binary variable).  The Gini impurity of the set is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mbox{gini_impurity}(y_1, \\ldots, y_n) =& f_0 \\times (1 - f_0) + f_1 \\times (1 - f_1)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f_c = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = c$.  In otherwords $f_c$ is the proportion of points in the set that belong to class $c$.  Since we are dealing with binary target variables, $c$ in this case will either be $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is the highest value that gini-impuritycan obtain?  What is the lowest?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to relate this back to the concept of the best possible split to our data, consider a possible split of our data.  Specifically, we will consider splits that arise from testing one of the two attributes for each data point (x or y) and comparing it to a threshold (e.g. $x > 50$ or $y > 100$).  Let $y^{p}_1, \\ldots, y^{p}_{n_{p}}$  denote the targets for the points that passed the Boolean test, and let $y^{f}_1, \\ldots, y^{f}_{n_{f}}$ denote the targets for the points that failed the Boolean test.  The impurity of this split is given by the following formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mbox{split_impurity}(y_1, \\ldots, y_n) =& \\frac{n_p}{n}\\mbox{gini_impurity}(y^{p}_1, \\ldots, y^{p}_{n_{p}}) + \\frac{n_f}{n}\\mbox{gini_impurity}(y^{f}_1, \\ldots, y^{f}_{n_{f}})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the impurity of a split is a weighted combination of the Gini impurity of each resultant subset weighted by the proportion of data that is assigned to each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill out the following function stub to compute the best possible split of the data using Gini impurity as a metric."
