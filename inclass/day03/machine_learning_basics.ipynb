    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Mitchell defines what it means for a computer program to learn in the following way: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition highlights a key difference between machine learning and classical statistical methods.  That is, machine learning is chiefly concerned with improving future performance based on prior experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference with classical statistical methods is that machine learning focuses on the computational efficiency (in both time and space) of algorithms.  For instance, an active area of machine learning research is to create algorithms that have computational efficiency properties that work with “big data”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Doing machine learning using scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific software package we will be using to do machine learning is called [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).  Scikit-learn is a very powerful package that supports a vast array of machine learning algorithms.  To get a sense of the toolkits capabilities check out the [examples page](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Versus Testing Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how machine learning differs from classical methods, we'll use an example taken directly from scikit learn's built-in datasets.\n",

    "The first step will be to load a dataset to use for our analysis.  First, we will be working with a dataset of Boston real estate prices.  In order to load the data and print out a detailed description of this dataset use the following code:"
